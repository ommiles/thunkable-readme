					In a discussion I typically will only contribute after analyzing the
					situation and will have fully considered any of my points before
					sharing them. I like to discuss every aspect of a project, and am
					meticulous with detail. I try not to, however, let this hinder myself
					from exercising my imagination. I prefer to share well‚Äêformed,
					rational ideas with my direct team, but also like to socialize and
					make conversation with other team members. I prefer to communicate in
					writing as this ensures clarity of meaning, but am not afraid to
					demonstrate practically and in person where necessary.

				<h2>How I like others to communicate with me:</h2>
				<p style={{}}>
					I like people who are fully aware of the current situation, and have
					evidence to back up their points or analysis and support their
					arguments rationally. While I do hold myself back a lot of times in a
					professional environment, I highly enjoy talking to open people and
					like having some small talk (my previous industry was very relaxed and
					casual in this area!). I like discussing ideas that are presented to
					me in a serious enough manner where I can understand them, and with
					enough energy and enthusiasm that I feel engaged.
