				How to Help Me:
			</h1>
			<div style={{ marginLeft: 50 }}>
				<h1>A Seat at the Table</h1>
				<p>
					I learn well through observation and pattern matching and enjoy having
					a seat at the table to do so. I find myself out of my comfort zone
					when asked to share or speak on the spot, however the more I observe
					and build trust, the more this improves.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div style={{ marginLeft: 50 }}>
				<h1>Give It to Me Straight</h1>
				<p>
					Help me set up what the parameters of a project or assignment are. I
					can only contribute something relevant and useful if you let me know
					what the goal for the end product is. Whether it's a long term or
					short term project, please help me set up some parameters for my
					independent work.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div style={{ marginLeft: 50 }}>
				<h1>The Big Picture</h1>
				<p>
					I appreciate arguments, decisions, and strategy backed by solid
					analysis. It's not mandatory nor does it make sense for every use
					case, but I'm able to contribute at my best when there's a clear and
					justified course of action (and a narrative beyond the data to boot).
				</p>
			</div>
			<div style={{ marginLeft: 50 }}>
				<h1>Help Me Establish an Industry Baseline</h1>
				<p>
					While I have an established professional history, I'm new to the tech
					industry. As I've shared with some of you already, some job titles,
					responsibilities, tools and techniques are new to me. Help me
					understand more of what you do, what circumstances we should and
					should not be collaborating, and, if you have time, what the industry
					standard or best practice looks like in your field.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div style={{ marginLeft: 50 }}>
				<h1>Call Me In</h1>
				<p>
					I'm not always a skilled diplomat and at times may cause offense.
					Although my intention is to provide helpful insights, they may not
					always be received that way. Please call me in immediately and let me
					learn.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div style={{ marginLeft: 50 }}>
				<h1>Verbal Communication Over Non-Verbal</h1>
				<p>
					I don't easily pick up social cues or immediately notice when a member
					of my team is experiencing a difficult situation. I'm working on this!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div style={{ marginLeft: 50 }}>
				<h1>Trust Fall</h1>
				<p>
					My initial instinct is to compel rather than inspire others to come to
					an agreement. I've gotten better at internal selling every year and my
					approach improves as my team develops and pursues its aims; and as my
					level of trust grows.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div style={{ marginLeft: 50 }}>
				<h1>Provide a Timeline</h1>
				<p>
					My inability to make quick decisions whilst in new territory can
					result in my contributions being lost when I work with others. If you
					need a shoot from the hip response from me, rather than a thoroughly
					informed and considered opinion, please let me know. There is a time
					and place for both :)
